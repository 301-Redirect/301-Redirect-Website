Until now Saudi Arabia remains one of the biggest jails in the Middle East. Most media professionals are being held arbitrarily and are likely subjected to torture, which is almost systematic for prisoners of conscience. <br>Journalists who voice criticism or analyze political problems are liable to be fired or detained under criminal code provisions or under vague but strict terrorism or cybercrime laws. Saudi Arabia permits no independent media. Everyone censors themselves, even on social networks, and authorities keep Saudi journalists under close surveillance \u2013 as the case of Jamal Khashoggi illustrated.",

He was a general manager and editor in chief of Al-Arab News Channel and served as editor for the Saudi Arabian newspaper Al Watan. Khashoggi fled Saudi Arabia in September 2017 and went into self-imposed exile to the United States after his column was abruptly canceled and he was banned from Twitter. In the U.S. he worked as a columnist for The Washington Post. Khashoggi was a sharp critic of some of the policies of Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince Mohammad bin Salman and denounced the imprisonment of fellow journalists. <br><br>On October 2, 2018, Khashoggi went to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get documents required for his imminent marriage. He was killed and dismembered inside the consulate, which the Saudi Arabian government first denied but later admitted. The crown prince accepted a political responsibility for Khashoggi\u2019s death but until today denies having ordered the killing or being aware of it beforehand.",

Almost all critical media outlets have been banned, blocked and/ or declared \u201cforeign agents\u201d, a status that comes with heavy bureaucratic hurdles and legal risks. Two draconian laws were adopted \u2013 under which \u201cfalse information\u201d about the Russian army and \u201cdiscrediting\u201d of the Armed Forces and its operations are now punishable by up to 15 years in prison. These laws forced literally all independent Journalists to flee abroad. The Kremlin massively also tightened censorship on the internet, numerous international social networks are blocked.

After the start of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, the medium gained national prominence and relevance: Ludi Baikala collected the numbers of fallen Russian soldiers and reported on their funerals - where journalists were not welcome.<br><br>On 15 April 2022, the website of Ludi Baikala was blocked by the Russian Media Regulator Roskomnadzor. Since then, the medium has only been accessible in Russia via VPN. It continues to conduct investigative research and publish journalistic texts.

The political apparatus has a tailor-made legislative arsenal that allows it to imprison any news and information provider who proves troublesome. Around 40 journalists are currently held in Vietnam\u2019s prisons, where mistreatment is widespread. The labyrinth of truth highlights Vietnams growing efforts to make it as hard as possible for its citizens to reach independent information.

Collusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists\u2019 safety and cripples the judicial system at all levels. Journalists who cover sensitive political stories or organized crime are warned, threatened and often gunned down in cold blood. Others are abducted and never seen again. <br><br>The years after 2006, when President Felipe Calder\xf3n declared a \u201cwar on drugs,\u201d saw a record number of murders and disappearances of journalists, as well as systematic impunity for these crimes. Some flee abroad as the only way to ensure their survival, while others censor themselves in fear of the deadly consequences. Andr\xe9s Manuel L\xf3pez Obrador, who was sworn in as president in December 2018, has pledged to make the fight against corruption his number one priority. But the initial hopes that Mexico could finally break free of the spiral of violence have not been fulfilled. <br><br>The murders of two prominent Mexican journalists in 2017 remain unsolved until today: <br><br>Miroslava Breach was an investigative journalist and was known for her reporting on human rights violations, drug trafficking and government corruption. Breach was killed on March 23, 2017 after she connected a mayoral candidate to the Sinaloa Cartel, causing him to lose the election. Aged 54, she was a single mother of two children.<br><br>Javier Valdez was a journalist and founder of the newspaper Riodoce, a weekly dedicated to crime and corruption in Sinaloa, one of Mexico\u2019s most violent states.
